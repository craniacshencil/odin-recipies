    <h1>Pancakes</h1>

    <p><strong>These buttermilk pancakes are passed down from my grandmother, 
    who was fully Scandinavian. They are light and fluffy, and great with 
    berry syrups. I have made these for years as a special treat, and I 
    hope you enjoy them as much as my family has.</strong></p>
